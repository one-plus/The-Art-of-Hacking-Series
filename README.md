The [Art of Hacking](http://theartofhacking.org) is a series of video courses that is a complete guide to help you get up and running with your cybersecurity career. This GitHub repository has been created to provide supplemental material, tons of references, scripts, and code that help you build your own hacking environment, examples of real-life penetration testing reports, DFIR, vuln research, exploit development, reverse engineering, and more.

# Open-source intelligence (OSINT)

Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is data collected from open source and publicly available sources. The following are a few OSINT resources and references:

- [GOSINT](https://github.com/ciscocsirt/gosint) - a project used for collecting, processing, and exporting high quality indicators of compromise (IOCs). GOSINT allows a security analyst to collect and standardize structured and unstructured threat intelligence.
- [Awesome Threat Intelligence](https://github.com/santosomar/awesome-threat-intelligence) - A curated list of awesome Threat Intelligence resources. This is a great resource and I try to contribute to it.
- [Umbrella (OpenDNS) Popularity List](http://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/umbrella-static/index.html) - most queried domains based on passive DNS usage across our Umbrella global network of more than 100 Billion requests per day with 65 million unique active users, in more than 165 countries.
